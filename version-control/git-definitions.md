# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
As best as I can describe, version control is the process of creating "shadow files" which allow one or more people the ability to make non-destructive edits to the main file (master) and gives them the ability to merge those edits with the main file once the edits have been tested and approved.
* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a version of the main file which contains the original code plus any edits made to that file.
* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
Commits are saved changes that have been made to branches, sort of like checkpoint saves in video games.
* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict happens when Git is unable automatically merge files itself.
